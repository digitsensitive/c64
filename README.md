## Installation

1. Download [TMPx](https://style64.org/release/tmpx-v1.1.0-style), the multiplatform cross assembler version of Turbo Macro Pro
2. Copy the `tmpx` of your platform (f.e. macOS) to a local folder of your choice
3. Allow `tmpx` to be executed as program: `sudo chmod +x PATH/tmpx`
4. Set the path to tmpx in the Makefile
5. Compile all `*.s` files with `make all`

## Tools

### Visual Studio Code
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. 
It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug
cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.

### Turbo Macro Pro Cross Assembler (TMPx)
[TMPx](http://turbo.style64.org) (pronounced "T-M-P cross") is the multiplatform cross assembler version of Turbo Macro Pro, itself derived from the famous Turbo Assembler series for the 
native C64. TMPx was the first cross assembler released with full support for the
syntax of Turbo Macro Pro (i.e. same as the original Turbo Assembler Macro).

### VICE
[VICE](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io) is a program that runs on a Unix, 
MS-DOS, Win32, OS/2, BeOS, QNX 4.x, QNX 6.x, Amiga, Syllable or Mac OS X machine
and executes programs intended for the old 8-bit computers.
The current version emulates the C64, the C64DTV, the C128, the VIC20, 
practically all PET models, the PLUS4 and the CBM-II (aka C610/C510).
An extra emulator is provided for C64 expanded with the CMD SuperCPU.
