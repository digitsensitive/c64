; COMMODORE 64 - Examples in 6502 Assembly language
; Â© Digitsensitive (digit.sensitivee@gmail.com)
; C64 User's Guide - Getting Started: Print Subtraction
;
; This example shows how to perform subtraction in assembly language.
; In this example we perform subtraction of two 16-bit numbers.
; The result is stored in an 16-bit number.
; So the maximum number is 65535 (a total of 65536 values, 0-65535).
; Subtracting 1 to 0 will wrap to 65535.
;
; Remember:
; * SEC means "set carry to 1", which indicates a "no-borrow" condition
; * There is no way to subtract without the carry which works as an inverse
;   borrow. i.e, to subtract you set the carry before the operation.
;   If the carry is cleared by the operation, it indicates a borrow occurred.
; * Decide if binary or decimal mode: In this example we use
;   the binary mode, so you should clear the decimal mode bit/flag with
;   the instruction 'cld' before doing any subtraction
;
; Example in BASIC:
; PRINT 10-2
